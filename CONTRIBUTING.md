:+1::tada: First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! :tada::+1:

This list is slowly growing with quality resources. In order to keep the list sane and clean, please follow these simple formatting guidelines;

- Make sure your resource is in the right category. If it's commercial put it in the non-free section.
- If a category or section doesn't exist yet, propose the category/section by adding it at the appropiate place and be sure to add it to the table of contents.
- If existing resources are not placed in the right category, move it in a different pull request or open an issue.
- If you add resources with descriptions, add a dash (-) after the link and end the description with a dot (.) .

Links are checked every day automatically, if a link is dead for multiple days we'll remove it.
